# Restaurant Inspection Data

## Source

State and municipal health departments inspect restaurants (as well as other food-serving facilities—nursing homes, for instance), and some of them provide the results of those inspections as bulk data. In some places, this is done by a state agency, in others it's done by local government.

## Types of data

* List of all known food establishments (useful on its own)
* Results of the most recent inspection
* Grades or scores (not available in all places)
* Narrative reports

## Examples of uses

* By exporting [LIVES](http://www.yelp.com/healthscores)-formatted data, Yelp could ingest and display this data
* Google may be amenable to incorporating this into their Google Place data, alongside reviews

## Existing organizations

* [Code for America](http://foodinspectiondata.us/)
* [HDScores](http://hdscores.com/)
