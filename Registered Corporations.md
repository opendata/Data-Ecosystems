# Registered Corporations

## Source

This is state-level data. The relevant agency varies from state to state. Many (most?) states allow searches of their database of registered corporations, but bulk downloads seem to generally require payment. [West Virginia, for instance](https://apps.wv.gov/sos/bulkdata/RegistrationInformation.aspx), sells this data for $12,000, plus $1,800 / year to keep the data updated.

## Types of data

* name
* ID
* type of entity
* jurisdiction
* date of registration
* status
* office location
* registered agent name and address
* number of shares

## Examples of uses

* Lead generation
* Information about attorneys, since they're listed as registered agents
* Knowing location of businesses (Google, Yelp, Foursquare, etc., etc.)
